                <h2>TOPIC 2: Information Processing Cycle and Computer Systems</h2>
                <p>This topic explores the Information Processing Cycle, a fundamental concept in computing. It explains the functions of the key components: input, processing, storage, and output. Input involves gathering raw data, processing transforms this data into meaningful information, storage retains the data for future use, and output presents the processed information in a usable form. Additionally, this topic highlights the distinction between data—unprocessed facts and figures—and information, which is organized and meaningful data that can support decision-making. Understanding how these elements work together is crucial for effectively managing and utilizing digital systems. </p>

                <p>This topic focuses on the classification of cybercrimes and the identification of effective countermeasures. It provides an in-depth understanding of various types of cybercrimes, such as hacking, phishing, identity theft, and data breaches. Additionally, it highlights strategies to mitigate risks, including the use of strong passwords, updating software regularly, and practicing safe online behavior. By understanding these concepts, we can reduce the likelihood of falling victim to cyberattacks and safeguard our personal and sensitive data against unauthorized access.</p>

                <p>This topic introduces the concept of creating websites using HTML and CSS, the foundational technologies for web development. It covers the basic syntax and structure of HTML, which defines the content and layout of a webpage, and CSS, which styles and enhances its appearance. Additionally, the lesson includes wireframing, an essential step in website development where we plan the structure and design of a webpage. By engaging in wireframe creation, we can visualize our website's layout and functionality before coding, ensuring a more organized and effective development process.</p>

            <h1>IT FUNDAMENTALS OUTPUTS</h1>
            <br>
            <p>This is one of my outputs for the IT Fundamentals course, where we were introduced to the basics of animation. As part of our hands-on learning, we created simple <br>animations such as the 'Bouncing Ball' and 'Walking Stickman.' These exercises helped us understand foundational animation principles, including motion, timing, and <br>keyframing techniques. Through these projects, I gained valuable experience in applying theoretical concepts to create engaging animations.</p>

            <p>
                This is my output for the Bouncing Ball animation. My experience was quite challenging, especially with illustrating each frame and moving on to the next one. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience.

            <p>
                This is my output for the Walking Stickman animation. It was the most challenging for me at the time, especially getting the walking positions right. I think I managed it, but I need more practice to make it look smoother and more balanced.

            <p>These are my digital artworks, and they are some of my favorites. I started doing digital art when I was in 8th grade using my mom's tablet. As the years passed, I grew more passionate about it and began drawing on my phone, then transitioned to my laptop. Eventually, I bought my own drawing tablet to practice even more. As of now, I am still honing my skills.</p>
